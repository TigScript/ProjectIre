                        skill matchup.Avoid fighting her at lvl 1 since you won't have passive and her Q destroys you
                        early on however don't be afraid to use the minions to your advantage if she is overly
                        aggressive. Start e and let her push you in. E her after she autos/q you so that your creeps
                        target her. Once it pushes to tower stack your passive and look for fights if you have a level
                        over her. Use your Q to avoid her parry or your flash if you don't have low HP minions around
                        you. Rule of thumb in this lane is, if you start a fight with full passive and full HP AND you
                        have low hp minions, you win if you dodge her W. It is easier after level 6 since they almost
                        always parry the E making her W very predictable. As long as you have ONE Q mark on her, you
                        will typically win if you start the fight with 5 stacks and have avoided her W. Avoid fighting
                        her after 2+ items unless ahead since its really hard to out damage her if she has tabi. Rush
                        executioners and look for fights asap once you have your botrk if the lane is going even.

                        I recommend avoiding fighting at level 1 and starting E and just letting him push you in early
                        on. You can build up passive under tower and look for fights after. You will win all ins granted
                        that you hit your E and have passive from the start. Try to only go for all ins if you are over
                        75% hp. Anything else he can easily beat you with grasp procs and auto/Q/his passive. After 6 it
                        gets a bit easier as you can open up with ult and 5 stacks and you can land your E on him with
                        the slow. It is fairly easy to beat him as long as you land everything. You beat him until 3-4

                        in a prolonged fight. Do try to get free autos in before you all in him. Post level 3, use your
                        W on his Q before it hits you and you will have a major advantage in this lane. Post 6 it gets a
                        little harder as you do have to watch your hp but as long as you chunk him a bit with your auto
                        range, W his Q and land your abilities (E/R) you will come out on top. I would avoid fighting
                        him post level 11 if you do not get ahead of him.

                        on. You crush him before he gets items. As long as you hit your abilities on him you will win
                        100% of the time assuming you have passive stacked. Use your Q on low hp minions to dodge his Q
                        and W and avoid being near walls when he is level 6 and has his ultimate form.

                        attacking quite easily and keep poking you with barrels so he can be a pain. Also most of the
                        people that will be playing Gragas tend to main him so that will also make things a bit more
                        difficult. The way I tend to beat Gragas is stack up passive and look for level 1-2 fights
                        because he won’t have all of his abilities that help him trade back. He is generally pretty
                        strong at level 3 due to his high base damage. You can also juke out his Q and E easily while
                        trading with him. It is quite easy to outplay him but you have to be careful with how easy it is
                        for him to disengage from you after chunking you heavily. So, I’d recommend only fighting him if
                        you have minions set up to juke him out so you don’t have to worry about him bursting you and
                        disengaging. Be careful when committing as if you miss anything he can easily run you down so
                        make sure you hit your abilities/have passive stacked before going for an all in.

                        early on. If you land your E at level 2 it is a guaranteed flash or kill from him depending on
                        how hard you chunk him. You can be extremely aggressive against him just make sure to be aware
                        of ganks. Post 6 it is crucial to avoid his combo as he can easily do 80%+ of your hp in a
                        second or two if you get hit by his combo. Avoid his combo and you are golden in all ins.</td>

                        my passive stacked (don't be afraid to auto her to make sure you don't lose your stacks). When
                        the wave is about in the middle, when you hit level 2 (preferably before her), land your E and
                        try to all in her, you will either get her flash or kill her. This setup will give you a large
                        advantage in lane, she will likely be passive after this and if she is chunked enough don't be
                        afraid to dive her. After level 3 it is a bit harder if she lands her E on you but it is

                        fighting her once she has cleaver even if you are super ahead of her. The reason for this is
                        even if she misses her E it will be up again as you are fighting her and if you die and give her

                        usually its better to start with e. Don't be afraid to auto him because if he presses e then you
                        can just simply stun him and run away. This will screw up the wave and it will push to you and
                        you can keep going for sneaky autos because your auto range is a lot longer but if you just go
                        for farm its also fine. You can use this to get level advantages which are pretty big early on.
                        Try to keep your passive at 5 stacks and auto attacking him whenever he is in range, if he is
                        close enough you go for an e and if you land your e don't be afraid to q on him and auto. After
                        lvl 6 It gets easier but it also gets very punishing if you make any mistakes after this point.
                        At level 6 jax gets a lot of extra damage from his R passive every third auto and is really
                        tanky with his ult. You have to start with a full passive in every fight and you also have to
                        make sure that his passive is not stacked, if it is his full passive is stronger than yours.
                        This is generally how the lane plays out until level 11. If you have not gotten ahead of him
                        after lvl 11 do not try to 1v1 him unless you have help on the way. His ult passive does too
                        much damage and his E cooldown will be very short but if you are ahead the same concept from
                        above applies.</td>

                        against other range matchups. He will look to poke you out at level 1 and jump on you with his Q
                        in melee form this is when you want to stun and auto him. Once it pushes under your tower you
                        can stack your passive and when it pushes back, if you have your passive stacked and you land an
                        E you absolutely destroy him. After level 3 try to use your W on his Q (either the empowered EQ
                        or the melee Q) as it is a bulk of his damage and you should be fine. It gets even easier at lvl
                        6 because he does not get a real ultimate and opening with your ult makes it easy to hit your E
                        on him.
